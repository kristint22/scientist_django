# Overview

The first programming lanuage I learned was HTML in high school. It was because of that class that I realized that I do like computers and I can be pretty fast at creating simple websites as well. However, it has unfortunately been too long since I used HTML and I decide that while I was brushing up on my HTML, that I wanted to learn something new as well. So, I decided to learn Django. Django is python based web framework that takes care of a lot of the work for you. Django applies my knowledge of python, html, and database into one go, and it was fascinating to learn.

This web application combines python and HTML to deliver a website to show famous chemist and phyists. All you need to do is go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and you can start you journey about chemistry and physics trailblazers. You should first see a page where you can learn about the two sciences and what their purposes are!



My purpose was to learn something new and to understand how to make a more dynamic page that works with a server that django uses.

# Web Pages

The first talks about what science is and briefly talks about how the other two pages are on chemistry and physics. Based on the the navigation site you click on the top it will go through the urls and then to that view to the function which will then call the html page that we will be seeing.

# Future Work

As always, you can always make you program better and more efficient. This is what I will be working on next to make my django even better!
* add another page
* add more data to the tables
* more user input 
* add more details/make the pages look more offical and impressive
* add a database to hold the data
